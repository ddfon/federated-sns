#### When to use *[sic]*

If there are typos, fix it in our copy. Instead of ‚Äúv1.2.3 realese‚Äù, fix it as ‚Äúv1.2.3 release‚Äù.

- Only use *[sic]* if it was intentional and might cause confusion (e.g. issues are opened, or PRs submitted, to correct it)
- Do not use *[sic]* if it is a proper noun (e.g. project or organisational name)

### Languages

This should not matter for this project, but in case a situation arises, this is our preferred style guide.

#### English dialect/variant

Philippine English is preferred (it is a mix of Philippine, Australian, American, and English English). If one is not familiar with Philippine English, the following can be used (in order of preference):

- Australian English
- English English
- American English

##### On: Serial/series comma

Serial, or series, comma (also called as the Oxford and Harvard comma), is a comma placed before *and*, *or*, *and so on*, and *etc.* in a series of more than three items.

1. Use a serial comma
1. Do not use a serial comma, if it will introduce ambiguity
