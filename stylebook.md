# DDFON Stylebook

## Proper nouns

- Capitalise every word
- Applies to:
  - Brand, Organisation, Network names (e.g. Fediverse, The Federation, W3C, Diaspora Foundation)
  - Names of people
    - Full name, if publicly available
    - Handle name, in the absence of any public name
    - Or, as preferred by the person, if requested (open an [issue](https://codeberg.org/ddfon/federated-sns/issues))
  - Protocol names (Nomad Communications, OpenMicroBlogging, OStatus, Diaspora Federation, Zot, ActivityPub)

## Title of works

- English: *italicised*
- Asian languages: 《 … 〈 … 〉 … 》
- Asian romanisation: « … ‹ … › … »
- Applies to:
  - Website, instance names (e.g. *The TWiT Army Canteen*, *Identi.ca*)
  - Software names (e.g. *Streams*, *Guppe*, *Friendica*, *Hubzilla*, *Takahē*, *Mastodon*)

## Content/parts of a work

- English: “ … ‘ … ’ … ” (a.k.a. smart quotes; typographic)
- Asian: 「 … 『 … 』 … 」
- Applies to:
  - Article titles (e.g. “The next Fediverse protocol reached W3C Recommendation status!”)
  - Release tags/titles/names (e.g. “v1.2.3 release”)
  - Quotations (e.g. “Sharing is caring” by Anonymous)

## For emphasis

- Use **bold**

## On stylised names

- For proper nouns: if requested only (open an [issue](https://codeberg.org/ddfon/federated-sns/issues))
- For title of works: allowed (e.g. *diaspora\**, *BookWyrm*, *PeerTube*)
- For content/parts of a work: allowed (e.g. Project A: “v1.2.3 When the fox jumped over the lazy dog”; Project B: “v3.4.5 When the Fox Jumped Over the Lazy Dog”)

### When to use *[sic]*

If there are typos, fix it in our copy. Instead of “v1.2.3 realese”, fix it as “v1.2.3 release”.

- Only use *[sic]* if it was intentional and might cause confusion (e.g. issues are opened, or PRs submitted, to correct it)
- Do not use *[sic]* if it is a proper noun (e.g. project or organisational name)
